            <p class="first text">Did you know that Cats are highly specialized and adaptable carnivorous mammals. They are digitigrade, 
                meaning that they walk on their toes, which is one of the reasons they can walk so silently. Typically, cats walk or run by moving the front and back legs on 
                each side together. Each paw hits the ground at a different point in the stride, which is known as a four-beat gait. Most of the cat’s weight is centered on the 
                front paws while walking.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="three haha">
            <img class="second" src="./assets/cat2.jpeg" alt="cat"/>
            <p class="second text">Cats are often considered aloof or unaffectionate, but that is a misunderstanding of their nature. They are solitary hunters but are nevertheless 
                social animals. As long as they are not competing for limited food resources, they can form close-knit groups that are usually composed 
                of the mother cat and her kittens and related females.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="four haha">
            <img class="third" src="./assets/cat3.jpeg" alt="cat"/>
            <p class="third text"> Cats are pretty cool! </br> A cat with a question-mark-shaped tail is asking, “Want to play?”
                According to Wilde, a slow blink is a “kitty kiss.” This movement shows contentment and trust.
                Cats have a unique “vocabulary” with their owner — each cat has a different set of vocalizations, purrs and behaviors.
                Cats have up to 100 different vocalizations — dogs only have 10.
                Cats find it threatening when you make direct eye contact with them.

        </div>
        <div class="five haha">
            <img class="fourth" src="./assets/cat4.jpeg" alt="cat"/>
            <p class="fourth text">Cats sleep out of boredom, too, just like us humans.
                 With their parents busy with work, cats may lose the enthusiasm to play by themselves, 
                 so they doze off out of sheer boredom. The best way to keep them occupied is by providing them with cat toys to
                  play with. Cats also love to play fetch or chase, just like dogs. Cats enjoy playing hide-n-seek, too. 
                  These games keep them happy, active, and healthy. </p>
